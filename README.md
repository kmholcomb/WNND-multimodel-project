## Prediction of West Nile virus disease by climate region

This repository contains R scripts for fitting and scoring models to predict West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease (WNND) cases in climate regions of the United States (2015-2021). We fitted ten models, ranging in complexity, to predict WNND cases across a hexagonal grid
